# Dot files

Mostly kept here (and public) to make it easy to add to a new machine

Add to system like so:
```bash
git clone THE_URL
cd .dotfiles  # Or wherever it is
bash build_links.sh
```

**Note: build_links.sh WILL delete all the existing dot files before replacing them with a soft link to these dot files**
