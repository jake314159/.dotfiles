$info
Handy when a test sometimes (but not always) fails and you want to run it
multiple times until it does eventually fail.

Example Usage:
  $ run2fail mocha -f "dodgy test"
"

# If a command fails then exit
set -e

# Keep running the command forever
while true; do
    $*
    sleep 0.1  # Makes it easier to kill with ctrl+c
done
